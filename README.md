Here you can access the source code of NewTabNextToActiveTab addon. This addon could be useful when you have many tabs and want the new tab to be close to your active tab because its content is going to be related.

The bulk of the code has been forked from https://github.com/gialloporpora/newtabintabcontextmenu. I have only added the moving part.
